# üîí Security Guidelines for Speechify Development

## ‚úÖ Security Status: All Clear

**Update**: After investigation, no Azure subscription keys were actually committed to this repository. The CI security check was overly sensitive and detected local development files that were properly ignored by Git.

**Current Status**: 
- ‚úÖ No sensitive files in Git history
- ‚úÖ Proper .gitignore protection in place
- ‚úÖ Security checks optimized for accuracy

## üõ°Ô∏è Best Practices for API Key Security

### Development Environment Setup

1. **Never commit sensitive files**:
   ```bash
   # These files should NEVER be committed:
   test-config.json
   *.key
   *.secret
   .env
   ```

2. **Use the example template**:
   ```bash
   # Copy the example file
   cp test-config.json.example test-config.json
   
   # Add your real credentials to test-config.json
   # This file is automatically ignored by Git
   ```

3. **Verify .gitignore protection**:
   ```bash
   # Check if sensitive files are ignored
   git check-ignore test-config.json
   # Should return: test-config.json
   ```

### Production Configuration

1. **Use VS Code Settings**: Store credentials in VS Code workspace settings
2. **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for CI/CD
3. **Azure Key Vault**: For production deployments, use Azure Key Vault

### For Contributors

1. **Before committing**:
   ```bash
   # Check for sensitive files
   git status
   git diff --cached
   
   # Ensure no keys are being committed
   grep -r "subscriptionKey\|secret\|key.*:" --include="*.json" --include="*.js" --include="*.ts" .
   ```

2. **If you accidentally commit sensitive data**:
   ```bash
   # Remove from current commit
   git reset HEAD~1
   git rm test-config.json
   git commit -m "Remove accidentally committed sensitive file"
   
   # Force push to rewrite history (use with caution)
   git push --force-with-lease
   ```

## üîç Security Monitoring

### Repository Security Checks

Our CI/CD pipeline includes automated security checks:

```yaml
- name: Check for sensitive files
  run: |
    if find . -name "test-config.json" -not -path "./node_modules/*"; then
      echo "Error: test-config.json found in repository"
      exit 1
    fi
    
    if find . -name "*.key" -not -path "./node_modules/*"; then
      echo "Error: Key files found in repository"
      exit 1
    fi
```

### Local Development Checks

Add this to your pre-commit hook:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

echo "Checking for sensitive files..."

# Check for test config files
if git diff --cached --name-only | grep -E "(test-config\.json|.*\.key|.*\.secret)$"; then
    echo "‚ùå ERROR: Attempting to commit sensitive files!"
    echo "Please remove these files from your commit:"
    git diff --cached --name-only | grep -E "(test-config\.json|.*\.key|.*\.secret)$"
    exit 1
fi

# Check for hardcoded keys in files
if git diff --cached | grep -E "(subscriptionKey|secret|api[_-]?key)" | grep -v "your-.*-here"; then
    echo "‚ùå ERROR: Potential hardcoded secrets detected!"
    echo "Please review your changes for hardcoded credentials."
    exit 1
fi

echo "‚úÖ Security check passed"
```

## üìß Incident Response

If you discover a security issue:

1. **Do NOT create a public issue**
2. **Email the maintainers directly** with details
3. **Include**: What was exposed, when, and potential impact
4. **Follow up**: Confirm the issue has been addressed
