# Speechify Extension Development Plan

## Project Overview
Transform Speechify extension from JavaScript to TypeScript with modern development practices, inspired by CueMode extension architecture.

**Current Status**: JavaScript VS Code extension (v1.3.0)
**Target**: TypeScript-based extension with i18n support, comprehensive testing, and modern development workflow

## Development Workflow and Checkpoints

### Checkpoint Management
Each phase represents a checkpoint in the development process:

1. **Phase Completion**: Complete all tasks in the current phase
2. **Plan Update**: Update this DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md with:
   - ✅ Mark completed tasks
   - 📝 Add implementation notes and decisions
   - 🔄 Update timeline if needed
   - 📊 Document any issues or solutions found
3. **Local Commit**: Commit changes to local repository to prevent data loss
4. **Progress Review**: Review achievements and plan next phase

### Testing Configuration
For simplified testing and development, use a local configuration file:

**File**: `test-config.json` (NOT committed to repository)
- Contains Azure Speech Services test credentials
- Automatically created during Phase 1 setup
- Used for development and testing purposes only

**Security Notes**:
- Add `test-config.json` to `.gitignore`
- Use only for development/testing purposes
- Never commit API keys to repository
- Production users must provide their own Azure credentials
